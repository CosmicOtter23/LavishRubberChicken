## 2D Top-Down Stealth

After finishing our A-Levels, some friends and I decided to run a small game jam among ourselves that would take place over a single weekend. We each came up with two themes and drew them randomly to decide on the two themes our games would revolve around. The two I got were 'negative space' and 'you're in a house but you don't live there'.

What first came to mind was a 2D game that utilises a black background to force the player into playing around sources of light, thus fulfilling the 'negative space' prompt. I played around with this idea in Unity a bit and decided I could create an interesting stealth-based game, so worked on adapting the 'you're in a house but you don't live there' prompt into it, and figured that this could be perceived as you are an intruder in the house. 

Once I had the foundations of the game, I could begin working on the levels. Since it was a game jam and I only had a couple of days to work on it, I couldn't feasibly design lots of levels to make a long game. Instead, I made the game as almost one big level that could be replayed multiple times to achieve a higher score. I also implemented a shop that the player could buy power-ups from to improve the replayability by making each playthrough different.
